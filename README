This is a very basic recommendaion engine.

Data set used: REUTERS data set

I have also used Apache Mahout

Item clustering is done via MinHash algorithm from Mahout.

User clustering is custom written and I will try to figure out how to use Mahout.

Recommendation engine is also very basic and custom written. Not sure how to use the Taste library from Mahout.

This is a very basic implementation done over a weekend. Feel free to comment. There will be lots of improvemts in the future!!
